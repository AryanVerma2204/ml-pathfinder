# ml-pathfinder
This is the collection of the notebooks I made as a coordinator of an ML refresher course hosted by Coding Club, IIT Guwahati
# week 1
1.[Optimisation algorithms](https://github.com/AryanVerma2204/ml-pathfinder/tree/master/Optimization%20algorithms): Contains implementation of gradient descent and its varients like momentum, mini batch and adam on a dataset.<p></p>
2.[Neural networks with Tensorflow](https://github.com/AryanVerma2204/ml-pathfinder/tree/master/neural%20nets%20intro%20tensorflow): Contains the basic know how needed to make functioning neural networks with tensorflow.<p></p>
3.[Keras Implementation](https://github.com/AryanVerma2204/ml-pathfinder/blob/master/keras_implementation.ipynb): self explanatory  ;)

# week 4
1. [Yolo Face Detection](): This contains the code for the project designed as a part of the course so that students could become well aquianted with Convolutional networks and their newer varients. You can download the model weigths [here]() if you want, though slightly big file.

You can visit the course page [ML Pathfinder](https://codingiitg.github.io/ml_week0.html#) to expand your deep learning concepts and explore exciting topics such as Convoluted Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks etc.For more such excitng courses, tutorials and webinars visit the [Coding Club IITG linkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coding-club-iitg/).
